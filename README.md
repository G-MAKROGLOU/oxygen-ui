# Getting Started with OXYGEN-UI

## WIP

### Local Setup

- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies
- Run the project with ```npm run storybook``` or ```yarn run storybook``` or ```pnpm run storybook```


  ### Changes & Fixes

  - Continue with calendar component fixes. Remove fetch, optimize useEffect etc.
  - Bundle the files in a better structure
  - Scan all created components for required changes
  - Write tests and mocks apart from doing behavioral tests with storybook
  - Setup ```msw``` for more tests
